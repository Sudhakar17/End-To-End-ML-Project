# End-To-End-ML-Project

In-order to understand the machine learning work flow, I followed the tutorials from the 2nd chapter of Hands-on-ML using Scikit-learn and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron. 

## Dataset

We will use the California Housing Prices [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices) from the StatLib repository. This dataset is based on data from the 1990 California census.

## Steps to follow for the Machine learning application.

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

The first seven steps are performed in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Sudhakar17/End-To-End-ML-Project/blob/master/End-To-End-ML-Project.ipynb)
